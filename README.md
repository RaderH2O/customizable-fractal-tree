# Customizable fractal tree!

## How to run?
Either start a web server (with anything , literally) or just open the index.html file in your browser

(From the left) The first one is the angle between every branch with the previous branch, the second one is the size of the tree, the third one is the maximum length of the branches (i.e the count of branches), the fourth one is for the thickness of branches

## How did you make it?
I made it with the p5.js library which is a really good library for anything related to graphics
